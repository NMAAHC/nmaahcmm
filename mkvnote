    $(basename "${0}")

    This application will embed key:value pairs ("tags") into a Matroska file.
   
    Usage: $(basename "${0}") [-p|--profile <profile>] /path/to/file

    Tag keys are pre-defined in sets: JPC or NMAAHC

    JPC:
        "COLLECTION"
        "TITLE"
        "CATALOG_NUMBER"
        "DESCRIPTION"
        "DATE_DIGITIZED"
        "ENCODER_SETTINGS"
        "ENCODED_BY"
        "ORIGINAL_MEDIA_TYPE"
        "DATE_TAGGED"
        "TERMS_OF_USE"
        "_TECHNICAL_NOTES"
        "_ORIGINAL_FPS"

    NMAAHC:
        "COLLECTION"
        "TITLE"
        "CATALOG_NUMBER"
        "DESCRIPTION"
        "DATE_DIGITIZED"
        "ENCODER_SETTINGS"
        "ENCODED_BY"
        "ORIGINAL_MEDIA_TYPE"
        "DATE_TAGGED"
        "TERMS_OF_USE"
        "_TECHNICAL_NOTES"
        "_ORIGINAL_FPS"
        "_TAGTAG"

    Tags beginning with an underscore are not part of the official set of Matroska tags as defined here:
    https://www.matroska.org/technical/tagging.html

    The script needs swiftdialog to run. It can be installed here:
    https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog/releases

    Calling the script will bring up a dialog window in which to enter values for the tag set you have chosen.

    The script can also be run in batch mode by feeding it a .csv

    filename	director    rating
    test.mkv	dave	    pg
    test2.mkv	blake	    no
    test3.mkv	immy	    g

    The filename should be the full path of the file.

    Usage: $(basename "${0}") mycsv.csv

    To produce a csv output from a list of mkv files:
    $(basename "${0}") -c file1.mkv file2.mkv file3.mkv > my.csv

    The output can then be edited to write back into the source files with "$(basename "${0}") my.csv"

    Tag definitions for JPC:
    Tag                     Example
    COLLECTION              The name of the collection that the content or object is from ; ex. Johnson Publishing Company Archive / Pearl Bowser Collection
    TITLE                   Should be the same as ASpace ; ex. Ebony/Jet Showcase #1001 / A Pinch of Soul
    CATALOG_NUMBER          Often the file name ; ex. JPC_AV_12345 / 2012.79.2.54.1a
    DESCRIPTION             Please be brief! Ok to leave blank! ex. In the 1980s a young journalist moves to New York City / Broadcast of the 1978 American Black Achievement Awards
    DATE_DIGITIZED          yyyy-mm-dd ; ex. 2024-10-10
    ENCODER_SETTINGS        Source VTR: model name, serial number, video signal type (Composite, SDI, etc.), audio signal type (analog balanced, analog unbalanced, embedded, etc.) ;
                            TBC/Framesync: model name, serial number, video signal type, audio signal type ;
                            ADC: model name, serial number, video signal type, audio signal type (if audio is embedded  at this point simply say "embedded") ;
                            Capture Device: model name, serial number, data connection type (Thunderbolt/PCIe/SATA/etc) ;
                            Computer: model name, serial number, computer os version, capture software (including version), encoding software (ffmpeg version not required)
    ENCODED_BY              Entity, name, country ; ex. Smithsonian NMAAHC, James Smithson, US (use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes)
    ORIGINAL_MEDIA_TYPE     Format (from PB Core), manufacturer, model ; ex. U-matic, Sony, KSP-30 (don't guess or estimate the manufacturer or model - the format is plenty sufficient if the others are ambiguous)
    DATE_TAGGED             yyyy-mm-dd, this is the date the mkv tags were embedded or updated ; ex. 2024-10-18
    TERMS_OF_USE            Not definitive, nor authoritative ; ex. Some or all of this video maybe subject to copyright or other intellectual property rights. Proper usage is the responsibility of the user.
    _TECHNICAL_NOTES        Free text for capturing anything concerning the inspection, conservation, digitization of the tape. ex. 
    _ORIGINAL_FPS           For motion picture film, the frames per second at which the film was meant to be projected. most common - 16, 18, 24 ; ex. 24
