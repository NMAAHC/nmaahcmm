# You can't directly call a function in another shell script. You can move your function definitions into a separate file and then load them into your script using the . command, like this:
# . /path/to/functions.sh
# The script will interpret functions.sh as if its content were actually present in your file at this point. It is a common mechanism for implementing shared libraries of shell functions, and is how each script in nmaahcmm can reference the shared functions in this file.
# Here is an example specific to NMAAHC:
## SCRIPT_PATH=${0%/*}      # SCRIPT_PATH will be the directory path of {0} which is the script being called
## . "${SCRIPT_PATH}/nmaahcmmfunctions"         # loads the functions in nmaahcmmfunctions into this script
## [[ -f "${SCRIPT_PATH}/nmaahcmmfunctions" ]] || { echo "Missing '${SCRIPT_PATH}/nmaahcmmfunctions'. Exiting." ; exit 1 ;};        # checks to see that that nmaahcmmfunctions exists; if it doesn't (left side of || exits non-zero) then it will execute the right side of ||
